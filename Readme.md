# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Room Cooling Optimization Using Numerical Methods

This project demonstrates the use of three essential **numerical methods**‚Äî**Gauss-Seidel**, **Golden Section Search**, and **Runge-Kutta 4th Order**‚Äîto optimize indoor cooling in a room using real temperature sensor data. It models wall heat distribution, determines the optimal air conditioning (AC) temperature for energy efficiency, and simulates how a room cools down over time.

## üìò Overview

Modern buildings rely on smart HVAC systems to balance **thermal comfort** and **energy efficiency**. This project simulates that process using real sensor data and applies numerical analysis to:

1. **Estimate wall temperatures**
2. **Find the energy-optimal cooling setpoint**
3. **Simulate cooling over time**

This program is written in **C++** and reads temperature data from a CSV file.

## üî¢ Numerical Methods

### 1. Gauss-Seidel Iteration
Used to approximate **steady-state wall temperatures** by solving a linear system derived from discretized heat conduction equations.

### 2. Golden Section Search
Used to find the **optimal AC temperature** that minimizes the following energy consumption cost function:
E(T) = (T - 22)¬≤ + 5

### 3. Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)
Simulates **time-based cooling** of the room using Newton's Law of Cooling:
dT/dt = -k(T - T_env)
where `T_env` is the optimal AC temperature and `k` is the cooling coefficient.
